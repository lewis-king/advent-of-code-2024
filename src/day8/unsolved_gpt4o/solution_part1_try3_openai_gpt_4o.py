#Certainly! Let's go through the process of determining the number of unique antinode locations. The problem requires us to identify points on the grid where two antennas with the same frequency are aligned such that one is twice as far from the midpoint as the other. To solve this, we'll need to:

#1. Parse the input to identify the positions and frequencies of antennas.
#2. Calculate potential antinode positions based on the criteria mentioned.
#3. Include antenna positions themselves as potential antinode locations.
#4. Count and print the unique positions that meet the criteria.

# This solution should correctly calculate the number of unique antinode locations based on the input from the file `input/input.txt`. Make sure that file exists and is correctly formatted according to the puzzle description.
