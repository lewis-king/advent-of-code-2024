#Let's tackle this problem by carefully checking for the X-MAS pattern as described. We'll ensure that two 'MAS' sequences form an X shape, where each 'MAS' can be read forwards or backwards. We'll account for all possible orientations of the pattern.

#Here is the improved solution:

### Key Improvements:
#1. **Pattern Checking:**
#   - We now check both the 'MAS' and 'SAM' sequences, allowing for each half of the X to be read in either direction.
#
#2. **Comprehensive Direction Handling:**
#   - We handle both primary diagonals and their reverse, effectively covering all potential X-MAS configurations.
#
#3. **Efficient Boundary Checking:**
#   - The `is_mas_sequence` function includes exception handling to prevent index errors when checking the grid bounds.
#
#This solution should provide the correct count of X-MAS patterns in the grid according to the defined rules.
