#Let's carefully address the problem by ensuring that we correctly identify the X-MAS pattern defined as two "MAS" sequences forming an X shape. Each sequence can be read forwards or backwards. We need to cover all possible orientations of this pattern.

### Explanation:
#1. **Input Reading:**
#   - Reads the grid from the specified input file path.
#
#2. **Pattern Checking:**
#   - For each cell in the grid, checks for 'MAS' sequences in both directions of each diagonal.
#
#3. **Direction Handling:**
#   - Uses two main diagonal directions and verifies both forward and reverse directions for the 'MAS' sequence.
#
#4. **Counting Logic:**
#   - Counts every valid occurrence of the X-MAS pattern, ensuring no out-of-bounds errors occur due to index checks.
#
#This solution is designed to ensure thorough checking of all possible configurations of the X-MAS pattern across the grid.
